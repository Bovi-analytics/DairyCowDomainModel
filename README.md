# Dairy Cow Domain Model

This repo is using scala version 2.13.16

Use Intellij or other IDE to work on the repository

If requested use the scala build tool (sbt) as compiler (not the one in Intellij)

In the terminal of the IDE (or other)

2 commands should work `sbt run` to compile the code into a jar (stored in target/scala-2.13) and `sbt doc` (stored in target/scala-2.13)
